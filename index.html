            The next post at the end of the year 2017 on our list of best-curated articles on – “Machine Learning”. These curated articles will be a one stop solution for people who are getting started with Machine Learning or who already have. This article contains all the best articles of 2017 which gathered the interest of the Machine Learning community.

Similar to the previous article on -“Best Deep Learning articles in 2017”, I have added the used tool and the level of difficulty for each article to facilitate you with the choice. If you wish to include any other learning resource/article here, please mention them in the comments.
Machine Learning has been with us since a long time ago, but it picked up pace about a decade back, part in thanks to the advancements in the hardware and in part to the Algorithms.

This article is about one such Algorithm which is extremely popular in the field of Machine Learning – Gradient Descent. This article explains in detail about how Gradient Descent works, the problems in the original Gradient Descent and the variants of Gradient Descent for overcoming the problem along with the implementation.
